 * call-seq:
 *   socket.connect(endpoint) -&gt; nil
 *
 * Connects the socket to the endpoint specified by the _endpoint_ argument.
 *
 * The _endpoint_ argument is a string consisting of two parts as follows:
 * _transport://address_.  The _transport_ part specifies the underlying
 * transport protocol to use.  The meaning of the _address_ part is specific
 * to the underlying transport protocol selected.
 *
 * The following transports are defined:
 *
 * [_inproc_] local in-process (inter-thread) communication transport
 * [_ipc_] local inter-process communication transport
 * [_tcp_] unicast transport using TCP
 * [_pgm_, _epgm_] reliable multicast transport using PGM
 *
 * With the exception of ZMQ:PAIR sockets, a single socket may be connected to
 * multiple endpoints using connect(), while simultaneously accepting
 * incoming connections from multiple endpoints bound to the socket using
 * bind(). Refer to ZMQ::Socket for a description of the exact semantics
 * involved when connecting or binding a socket to multiple endpoints.
 *
 * &lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; The connection will not be performed immediately, but as needed by
 * 0MQ.  Thus, a successful invocation of connect() does not indicate that
 * a physical connection was or can actually be established.
